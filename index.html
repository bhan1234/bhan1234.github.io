        <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
        <p style = "block1;"> My name is Billy Han and I will be keeping this page up-to-date with everything that I am currently doing. 
        This will also (eventually) become a good way to keep track of what I have done. 
        In the next few months I will be filling in the gaps on what I have done up to this point in my life.
        Afterwards, I plan to keep this updated every 6 months with new updates in my life, books I've been reading, and skills that 
        I have learned. Thanks for stopping by!  </p>

        <h1>Who I am</h1>
        <p> I was born and raised in Milwaukee Wisconsin, and recently graduated from UW Madison Business School with Real Estate and Statistics majors. 
          In a few short months I will be joining BNP Paribas as an investment banking analyst in New York City.
          I am a very outgoing person, and love learning new skills and meeting new people.
          I enjoy reading, painting, cooking, and biking. I’m also very competitive and love playing basketball and golf.
          I will always support my Wisconsin teams and nothing beats going to a Bucks, Packers, or Brewers game (whenever sports come back).

        <p>I will be keeping this page up-to-date with everything that I am currently doing. 
        This will also (eventually) become a good way to keep track of what I have done. 
        In the next few months I will be filling in the gaps on what I have done up to this point in my life.
        Afterwards, I plan to keep this updated every 6 months with new updates in my life, books I've been reading, and skills that 
        I have learned. Thanks for stopping by!  </p>
